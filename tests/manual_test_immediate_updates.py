Manual Test Checklist: Immediate Menu Action Updates

ISSUE FIXED:
When clicking menu actions (like "Disable Lights"), changes should apply 
immediately rather than waiting for the next polling cycle.

TEST STEPS:

1. DISABLE LIGHTS TEST:
   - Start GlowStatus with light control enabled
   - Set a status that makes lights turn on (e.g., "Set Status: In Meeting" - should be red)
   - Right-click tray icon → click "Disable Lights"
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Lights should turn OFF immediately
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Tray tooltip should show "(Lights OFF)"
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Menu should now show "Enable Lights"

2. ENABLE LIGHTS TEST:
   - With lights disabled, click "Enable Lights" 
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Lights should apply current status immediately (e.g., red for meeting)
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Tray tooltip should remove "(Lights OFF)"
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Menu should now show "Disable Lights"

3. ENABLE SYNC TEST:
   - With calendar sync disabled, click "Enable Sync"
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Status should refresh immediately from calendar
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Lights should update to match new status immediately
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Tray tooltip should remove "(Sync OFF)"

4. MANUAL STATUS TEST (already working):
   - Click "Set Status: In Meeting" 
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Lights change to red immediately
   - Click "Set Status: Available"
   - ✅ EXPECTED: Lights change immediately (green or off depending on config)

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Added turn_off_lights_immediately() method to GlowStatusController
- Updated toggle_light() to call this method before disabling light control
- Updated toggle_sync() to call update_now() when enabling sync
- All manual status functions already called update_now() for immediate updates

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
- src/glowstatus.py: Added turn_off_lights_immediately() method
- src/tray_app.py: Updated toggle_light() and toggle_sync() functions
